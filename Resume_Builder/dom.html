            <h2>SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket debris lands on US farm, Check details</h2>
            <b >In a bizarre incident, a farm owner in the US was left in shock
                when a pressure vessel from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
                fell on his property in Washington state, leaving a 
                "4-inch dent in the soil".In a normal course, most second 
                stage parts either hang out in orbit for years or re-enter Earth over the ocean.
                The debris was identified as Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel (COPV)
                from the break-up of a Falcon 9 second stage over Oregon and Washington state on March 26,
                reports The Verge, quoting local officials.Thehe stage re-entered the atmosphere in an unusual spot in the sky after sending a payload of SpaceX`s Starlink satellites to orbit.
                The farm owner in Grant County, Washington state, found the pressure vessel and reported it to the Grant County Sheriff`s Office. </b>
